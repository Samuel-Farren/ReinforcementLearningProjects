# ReinforcementLearningProjects
Projects for RL While at Georgia Tech Grad School
## Project 1 
  was a reimplementation of Richard Suttons Temporal Differnce Learning Paper. 
## Project 2 
  was using A Deep Q Learning Keras Neural Network to solve an OpenAI Gym Environment to have an agent learn how to safely land a lunar lander within a target.
